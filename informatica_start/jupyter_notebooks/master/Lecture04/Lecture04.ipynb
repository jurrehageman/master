    "File objects need to be closed using the file.close() method. While this is not crucial for reading files, it is for writing. If you forget to close your file after write operations, this may cause data loss. Fortunately, Python offers a content managment protocol that automates the closing of the file. You can use the content management protocol using the with statement that acts as a wrapper to ensure that your file will always close. If you want to know more about the content management protocol (and maybe want to write your own context management class) see chapter 9 of your book. For know we limit ourself on the use of the with statement instead of explaining the internal details on how it works:"
